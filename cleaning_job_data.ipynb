You can\\'t do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don\\'t share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions. We are backed by Y Combinator, and we are powering the sales teams at some of the fastest-growing companies in the world like Deel, Moveworks, H1 and Vanta.\\r\\n\\r\\nAre you up for a challenge? Amplemarket welcomes spontaneous applications from talented people who are eager to join our team.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are always on the lookout for exceptional Backend Engineers who want to revolutionize the future of sales, while thriving in an incredible Engineering environment.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile we may not be prioritizing this opening at the moment - and, therefore, might take a bit longer to get back to you - we review spontaneous applications regularly and if your profile stands out, we’ll definitely want to get to know you\\r\\n\\r\\n[heading2]Software engineers build the core of Amplemarket.[/heading2]\\r\\n\\r\\nBackend engineers build the core of Amplemarket. The three co-founders have an engineering background (João, Luís and Mica studied Physics & Computer Science in university) and deeply value the work that engineers are responsible for.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur main goal is to build a sales platform that helps companies grow. Our product requires us to solve a myriad of difficult engineering problems very diverse in nature: from working on NLP models that can extract information from a thread of emails to scaling an Elasticsearch cluster holding terabytes of data.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe are deeply aware of the importance of our tool to our customers and look for people that share that vision.\\r\\n\\r\\nAmong other things, our stack includes:\\r\\n\\r\\nRuby on Rails, React, PostgresQL, Elasticsearch, Redis\\r\\n\\r\\nWe don\\'t require you to have experience in our stack to apply.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur customers use Amplemarket on a daily basis. We keep and enrich valuable data that is critical for sales reps\\'s success. We need to keep these TB of data organized and easily accessible. Luckily, you are reading this, and when you join Amplemarket our performance will skyrocket.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs an early member of engineering team, you will build reliable backend systems and design state-of-the-art APIs to enable new product features.

You can\\'t do this with 5 different data/sales enablement point solutions that don\\'t share the same data schema and barely communicate with each other. Amplemarket is the all-in-one compound solution that enables this.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur AI-powered sales platform helps B2B companies generate more opportunities thanks to our advanced lead generation engine, hyper-personalized sequencing, omnichannel outreach, and AI-powered smart actions.

Boom & Bucket\\r\\n\\r\\nA lot of people say that they\\'re \"revolutionizing an industry,\" 99% of that is marketing fluff. The truth is that most of those revolutionaries are building mediocre SaaS products for underserved markets. It\\'s easy to conflate revolution with evolution when the status quo hasn\\'t moved. That\\'s not us.\\r\\n\\r\\nOur customers build the world with their heavy machines. Many have been in business for decades. Their businesses built our roads and bridges, subdivisions and stadiums. Our industry is smart, sophisticated, and savvy. They tell us that they\\'re not happy with the way equipment is purchased and sold. So, along with our customers, we\\'re building the Modern Marketplace for Heavy Equipment.
