# Junior Job Description Analysis

It's hard knowing what to study and where to focus your efforts as a junior in tech. This project aims to help, with a dashboard displaying information about tech jobs at the junior level only. 
This repo consists mainly of a jupyter notebook where data was cleaned - cleaning was done in Python since there was a lot of text data that needed analyzing. 
The original dataset was given to me and is original data not found anywhere else.
